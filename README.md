# geo-csv-corrector
Is a small tool allowing users to visualise geo-data stored in a csv format, by
draging and droping the file into the map.

Additionally the user can fix the coord of the data by draging the marker to the
right spots, or changing description on the popup.

Finally the user can download the fixed version of the csv file.
